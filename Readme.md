## Abstract
The Stellar Asset Contract makes it possible to wrap any native Stellar asset into an ERC20-like token. By tokenizing these assets, we can use them as collateral in Soroban smart contracts. A Constellation Token holds a basket of Soroban tokens as collateral, and exposes an arbitrage mechanism through issuance and redemption.

## Motivation
Index funds play a large role in traditional finance, with over $10 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500 alone. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) can be conveniently bought or sold through a brokerage like Robinhood and provide diversification at a low cost.

Constellation Protocol aims to bring the ease of bundling together multiple Stellar assets into a single Constellation Token, which behaves like an on-chain ETF.
