# Constellation Protocol

Constellation Protocol is an open protocol for Index Funds on Stellar/Soroban. 

Index funds have become an integral part of our financial system, with over $10 Trillion invested in them worldwide. Smart contracts and token standards can bring trust-minimized indexing and fund management to blockchains. Index funds built on public blockchains can be cheaper to operate, and more transparent than centralized versions available today. This is the driving motivation behind Constellation Protocol.

Inspired by Set Protocol on Ethereum, Constellation Protocol aims to make it easy and affordable to create & manage index funds on Stellar. The Stellar Network is uniquely fast, low cost, and has strong built-in compliance features.

Constellation Protocol is made possible by funding from the [Stellar Community Fund](https://communityfund.stellar.org/).
For SCF #18 we developed the core smart contracts for creating tokenized index funds. We also published instructions and scripts for how to deploy Constellation Tokens to Stellar Testnet. 
For SCF #23 we are developing a front-end UI for creating & managing an index fund using Constellation Protocol, as well as a place for users to discover and buy them. We will also be developing additional smart contracts to allow fund managers to trade their funds underlying holdings on DEXes, starting with Soroswap. 
For more information, see our latest Stellar Community Fund [pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GdJ0NtHtlsFAgcCFNpL2I0DMvIeyErCgB3REfqOmoqI/edit?usp=sharing), and proposed [technical architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fshBw12ylQOyLi0Ls6xgKSQMVqW49BlWkdVHMy-jv8w/edit).

(*) The front-end will initially connect to Testnet only.
