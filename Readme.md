# Constellation Protocol
![Constellation Protocol](https://github.com/ysfkel/constellation-protocol/blob/readme-image/images/logo6.png "Optional title") 

A Constellation Token holds a basket of Soroban tokens as collateral, and exposes an arbitrage mechanism through issuance and redemption.

Motivation
Index funds play a large role in traditional finance, with over $10 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500 alone. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) can be conveniently bought or sold through a brokerage like Robinhood and provide diversification at a low cost.

Constellation Protocol aims to bring the ease of bundling together multiple Stellar assets into a single Constellation Token, which behaves like an on-chain ETF.
